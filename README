OCamlEV3-bindings
=================

by Tortrat-Gentilhomme Nicolas, Raymond Nicolas and Runarvot Lo√Øc;
created during a course named "Projet Long" at Paris 7.

The project was used as is (see the tag v0.1) during the final project; it was
working correctly, but due to lack of time, the bindings were implemented
without using the full strength of OCaml.

It's currently WIP, and many changes may occurs during next weeks before its
usability.

Few changes example:
    - better usage of GADT
    - implementation for every available sensors at ev3dev wiki.
    - integration of an opam package
