(** The IO module contains every usefull functions to read and write any data
    coming from a file.
    For now, it doesn't keep in memory any channel. *)


(** {2 Reader} *)

val mk_reader : (string -> 'a) -> (string -> 'a)
(** [mk_reader wrapper] create a reader where the given string is wrapped into
    the needed type.
    For example, int reader is created as [mk_reader int_of_string] *)

val read_string : string -> string
(** [read_string path] read the first line of the file at [path]. *)

val read_int : string -> int
(** [read_int path] read the first integer of the file at [path]. *)


(** {2 Writer} *)

val mk_writer : ('a -> string) -> (string -> 'a -> unit)
(** [mk_writer unwrapper] create a writer that make the transformation of the
    data into a string, and write it to the first line.
    For example, int writer is created as [mk_writer string_of_int] *)

val write_string : string -> string -> unit
(** [write_string path data] write [data] to the file at [path] *)

val write_int : string -> int -> unit
(** [write_int path data] write [data] as an integer to the file at [path] *)
